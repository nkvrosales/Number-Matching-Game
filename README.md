# Number-Matching-Game
In this game there are 16 tiles that are blank at the start of the game which you need to flip all to win the game. In order to flip a tile, you need to click the tile that will show numbers that you need to match. To get a correct match you should click on the same tile that have the same value of number. If you got an incorrect match, you can still try again until you finish the game. This game is a test to your memory if you can remember correctly what number is hidden on the tiles. If all the tiles are flipped correctly the tiles will turn green and will end the game. If you want to play again there is an option to reset or to exit the game.
